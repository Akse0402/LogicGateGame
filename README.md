Welcome to the Logic gate game!

The general plan with making this game was to practice my coding skills and get better.
Also basic logic gates can be trained meanwhile. 

The final goal with the game is to create it in Pygame or another framework, so the inputs are not based on the terminal ...

Frameworks & module used:
- NumPy
- Pygame
